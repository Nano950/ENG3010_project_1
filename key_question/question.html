                <h2><span>RQ:</span> How will the introduction of artificial intelligence into the workplace impace softaware developers?</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="rationale">Within the software development discourse community,
                     one major conversation point in how the introduction of artificial 
                     intelligence into the software development life cycle will impact the 
                     jobs of existing and future developers. This question is also personally 
                     relevant as I plan on engaging in software development in a professional 
                     capacity, therefore having an understanding of how the integration of a 
                     new and potentially disruptive technology may shape my job prospects in the 
                     future. An understanding of how Artificial intelligence will shape the 
                     workforce of software development in the future will also allow me to better 
                     adapt to an ever-changing environment while gaining an understanding of how to 
                     better optimize my learning and workflow.</p>

                <p>This academic article describes the potential for generative AI such as ChatGPT to 
                    impact the workplace and education, along with AI’s potential to enhance 
                    productivity as well as the challenges of integrating AI into the workplace and 
                    higher education. The Author of the article is PhD associate professor at the SP 
                    Jain School of Global Management. He is the sole author of the paper and has not 
                    stated conflicting interests between the contents of the article. This article is 
                    relevant to my research question as it provides insight into the various barriers 
                    that prevent AI in the workplace of software development.</p>

                <p>This source explores the emerging coexistence between workers and artificial 
                    intelligence in workplaces, emphasizing four primary themes: workers' 
                    distrust of AI due to job security concerns, AI's potential to augment 
                    human abilities, the need for technical, human, and conceptual skills, and 
                    the ongoing requirement for upskilling and reskilling. All of the authors 
                    of this article are professors at various universities across the world, 
                    and while there is no explicit mention of conflicting interests, there is 
                    also no statement declaring otherwise, which may suggest that a conflict of 
                    interest may exist between the content of the work and the organization 
                    funding this research. This source is relevant to my research question as 
                    it addresses how AI will change various aspects of the workplace as well as 
                    addressing the use and importance of various skills.</p>
