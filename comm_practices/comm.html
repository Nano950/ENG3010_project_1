                <h3>An exploratory study in communication in Agile Global Software Development</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The structure and tone of this research paper indicate a highly formalized style of
                    writing, as it begins with an abstract of the journal's contents. The sections of 
                    the paper are consistent with the expectations of a research paper, beginning with 
                    the methodology of the study, with descriptions of the research environment, data 
                    collected, and discussions of data Throughout the article, the tone of the writer 
                    remains impersonal throughout the article, which appeals to the expectations to the 
                    academic writing genre. The article discussed more efficient ways for software 
                    development teams to communicate during agile sprints. The study found that the use 
                    of various technologies such as smart boards was helpful, however, it is important 
                    to note that this study was written in 2016, and is not reflective of the current 
                    landscape of technology used by the agile development team.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One way that the authors of this article ensure that the content within remains 
                    relevant to the readers of the article is by adopting an organization style that 
                    begins with a summary of the purpose of the paper, as well as the findings of the 
                    study. This method of organization ensures that the readers are aware of the 
                    contents of the article, and can make the determination of whether or not the 
                    article is relevant. The authors of the article rely on empirical analysis to make 
                    the determination that smartboards were beneficial to communication between 
                    developers in agile software development.</p>

                <h3>Stack Overflow</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The content within Stack Overflow is user-generated based on questions asked 
                    by other users. Within each question asked, all user responses are listed 
                    below the original questions sorted based on the number of upvotes each 
                    response to the question receives. As the content of the questions along 
                    with responses to questions are written by a large variety of developers 
                    at varying levels of expertise, the tone and writing styles vary greatly. 
                    There are some indications of more informal tones through the frequent use 
                    of contractions; however, the style of writing across both questions asked 
                    and the answer remains direct and focused on delivering information. </p>
                <br>
                <p>For questions asked, user-generated content follows a very specific style of 
                    organization. Most questions begin by stating a highly specific problem 
                    that a user is facing. The question then may include some visual 
                    representation of the problem, mostly by including images of the code that 
                    the user suspects is resulting in the problem along with any relevant code 
                    in other files or sections of a project. Answers from users follow a similar 
                    format: they begin by stating what part of the code that the initial user 
                    shared is causing a bug or an error, and either follow this description by 
                    displaying the corrected code, or some form of content that can be quickly 
                    copied and pasted into the initial project. This style of organization allows 
                    users attempting to answer questions to quickly understand the nature of the 
                    problem while also allowing the users asking questions to easily comprehend 
                    and apply the solutions offered by other users.</p>

                <h3>An Interactive Guide to Flexbox</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The blog post discusses the various aspects and concepts behind a method for 
                    responsively displaying content on a website based on the side of a userâ€™s 
                    screen. It uses an informal style of writing to make the concept being 
                    discussed more accessible to the audience. Many images and interactive 
                    visual aids are mixed in throughout the length of the blog, which helps to 
                    convey the introduction of concepts within the post. Various aesthetics 
                    within the text such as highlights and varying font weights are used 
                    throughout the blog post to emphasize sections of content that may be of 
                    particular interest to a reader, such as interactive elements.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The use of interactive elements throughout the blog post allows for better 
                    contextualization of the concepts being presented throughout the article. 
                    When discussing the differences between the options for the align-items, 
                    and justify-content properties, an interactive vein diagram is shown 
                    displaying the exclusive as well as the shared values for justify-content 
                    and align-items. The use of highlighting important sections of content is 
                    used to convey various types of information to the readers. Sections 
                    highlighted in blue indicate extensions of concepts being discussed. 
                    Sections highlighted in green indicate important takeaways from the 
                    article, such as a more useful interpretation of a larger body of 
                    knowledge in order to better grasp the concepts being discussed in the blog 
                    post. Sections highlighted in yellow indicate information that allows users 
                    to avoid running into problems when applying the various concepts within the 
                    blog, such as creating awareness for the potential consequences of misusing 
                    properties such as min-width when using Flexbox. These visual supplements to 
                    the writing within the blog post allow the content discussed to be more 
                    accessible to members of the discourse community who may not be actively 
                    aware of the pitfalls of various applications of concepts discussed.</p>
